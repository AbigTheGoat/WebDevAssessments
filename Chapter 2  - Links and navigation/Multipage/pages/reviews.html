        <p2>"If you put an 8-year-old boy's imagination to paper, the result would be pretty close to the place Finn and Jake call home. Few rules of the real world apply in Ooo, where there's really no telling what adventures each day will bring. Older kids capable of getting the show's tongue-in-cheek, ironic, and referential humor will revel in the nonsensical fun, and are likely to be hooked by the sumptuous and surprisingly deep Adventure Time universe" - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5 Common Sense media. </p2><br>
        <p2>For a kids show, Adventure Time has surprising mature and deep themes, making it a joy to watch for all ages - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ IMDB user</p2><br>
        <p2>While some shows start off a bit shaky, Adventure Time is on fire, pretty much from the start of the series. The humor is lightning-fast and refreshingly funny. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4/5 IGN movies.</p2><br>
